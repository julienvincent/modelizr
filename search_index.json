It was specifically written for use with GraphQL - but if you have a REST api instead or some other achitecture, it will\nstill work with modelizr.\nYou can use modelizr for writing queries, mocking, making requests and normalizing data.\nWhat it solves\n\nWhen working with a GraphQL server, you will almost always have deeply nested queries and responses that match - but no one wants to work with data that is structured like that.\nSo we use normalizr, however we then need to write normalizr schemas and describe the structure of the response to normalizr in order for it to know how to flat-map the response.\nWith modelizr, you get normalizr for free. You write a query and normalizr can infer how to flat-map your response.\n\nTrying to integrate mocks into your application can be tedious, especially getting it to return data that matches your GraphQL responses. There is the option of having your\nAPI return mocks according to defined GraphQL types - but what if you haven't constructed the API yet and you still want to mock? Again you get this for free with modelizr.\nYou write your queries once, and you get mocked data that matches the same structure as the query. Exactly how you would get your real response from GraphQL.\n\nWriting queries can be ugly and hard to read, especially as it is hard to format in a text editor or IDE. Modelizr queries are more readable and easier to write.\n\n\n\nhave a look at the usage example to get an idea of how you can integrate it into your application.\n"},"docs/usage/":{"url":"docs/usage/","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"Usage\nWhat follows is a simple usage example for setting up and using modelizr to mock, generate queries and normalize responses.\n\nCreating Models\nQuerying\nMocking\nProduction\n\n"},"docs/usage/Models.html":{"url":"docs/usage/Models.html","title":"Creating Models","keywords":"","body":"Creating Models\nModelizr is a tool that revolves around the models you create. Query generation, data mocking and normalization are all based on the structure of the models\nthat you build.\nIn this usage example we will be creating 4 models:\n\nPerson\nDog\nCat\nAnimal - Union of Dog and Cat\n\nModels are defined by creating schemas. These schemas are then converted into Modelizr models and can be then used in queries. When creating these schemas we need to describe:\n\nThe model's normalization key. This is a string that all variations of the model will be normalized as.\nThe model's fields and field types. These are used when generating the GraphQL request and mocking a response.\nOther model relationships that are associated with the model.\n\nconst Person = {\n  normalizeAs: \"People\",\n  fields: {\n    id: {\n      type: String,\n      alias: \"ID\" // The generated query will contain the alias ID\n    },\n    firstName: String,\n    age: Number,\n    Friend: \"Person\", // Reference the 'Person' model as a relationship\n    Pets: [\"Animal\"] // Wrapping a reference in an array indicates a collection\n  },\n  primaryKey: \"id\" // Which field to use as the primary key.

To create a union you need to define an array of models of which it is a union of, and a schemaAttribute which is a key on each model\nthat describes the type of model it is.\nimport { union } from 'modelizr'\n\nconst Animal = union({\n  models: [\"Cat\", \"Dog\"],\n  schemaAttribute: \"__type\"\n})\n\nNow that we have defined out model data, we can pass it into modelizr and get back model functions which are used when making queries:\nimport { Modelizr } from 'modelizr'\n\nconst {models, query, mutate, fetch} = new Modelizr({\n  models: {\n    Person,\n    Dog,\n    Cat,\n    Animal\n  },\n  config: {\n    endpoint: \"http:// ...\"\n  }\n})\n\nconst {Person, Dog, Cat, Animal} = models\n\n"},"docs/usage/Querying.html":{"url":"docs/usage/Querying.html","title":"Querying","keywords":"","body":"Making Queries\nModels can be used inside of query tools to generate a GraphQL query and send it off to the server.\nLets try use our models we have defined to query a Person, the persons Friend and his Pets.\n...\n\nconst {Person, Dog, Cat, Animal} = models\n\nquery(\n  Person({id: 1},\n    Person(\"Friend\"),\n\n    Animal(\"Pets\"\n      Dog, Cat\n    )\n  )\n).then((res, normalize) => {\n    ...\n})\n\nInternally this will generate a GraphQL query and post it to the configured endpoint. The query generated will look as follows:\nquery modelizr_query {\n  Person(id: 1) {\n    id,\n    firstName,\n    age,\n    Friend {\n      id,\n      firstName,\n      age\n    },\n    Pets: {\n      ... on Cat {\n        __type,\n        id,\n        name\n      },\n\n      ... on Dog {\n        __type,\n        id,\n        breed,\n        name\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe actual GraphQL response received might look something like this:\nconst res = {\n  data: {\n    Person: {\n      id: 1,\n      firstName: \"John\",\n      age: 20,\n      Friend: {\n        id: 2,\n        firstName: \"Jimmy\",\n        age: 21\n      },\n      Pets: [\n        {\n          __type: \"Cat\",\n          id: 1,\n          name: \"James\"\n        },\n        {\n          __type: \"Dog\",\n          id: 3,\n          breed: \"Labrador\",\n          name: \"Bran\"\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis is expected, but not something we want to work with. Within our application's state we want to store data in a flat map. Modelizr can do this by \nlooking at the model relationships already defined previously. Internally it uses normalizr to achieve this. \nHere is how we can normalize our response:\n...\n\nquery(\n  Person({id: 1},\n    Animal(\"Pets\"\n      Dog, Cat\n    )\n  )\n).then((res, normalize) => {\n  const {entities, result} = normalize(res.data)\n\n  /* And now we can use it in our application */\n  store.dispatch({\n    type: \"SET_ENTITIES\",\n    payload: entities\n  })\n})\n\nThe resulting flattened entities will now look like this:\nconst entities = {\n  People: {\n    1: {\n      id: 1,\n      firstName: \"John\",\n      age: 20,\n      Friend: 2,\n      Pets: [\n        { \n          id: 1,\n          schema: \"Cat\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: 3,\n          schema: \"Dog\",\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n     },\n     2: {\n       id: 2,\n       firstName: \"Jimmy\",\n       age: 21\n     }\n    },\n\n    Cats: {\n        1: {\n          id: 1,\n          name: \"James\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    Dogs: {\n     3: {\n          id: 3,\n          name: \"Brad\",\n          breed: \"Labrador\"\n     } \n    }\n}\n\nMaking a mutation is just as simple. Lets try changing a Persons name and age!\nmutate(\n  Person({id: 1, firstName: \"James\", age: 21})\n)\n\nThis will generate a GraphQL mutation and post it at the configured endpoint:\nmutation modelizr_query {\n  Person(id: 1, firstName: \"James\", age: 21) {\n    id,\n    firstName,\n    age\n  }\n}\n\nNow on to mocking!\n"},"docs/usage/Mocking.html":{"url":"docs/usage/Mocking.html","title":"Mocking","keywords":"","body":"Mocking\nThe goal with mocking is to produce data that is structured in the exact same way as an actual GraphQL response.\nLets mock the query for a Person we made in the previous step:\nquery(\n  Person({id: 1},\n    Animal(\"Pets\"\n      Dog, Cat\n    )\n  )\n).mock() // => Appending the 'mock' results in a mocked response\n.then((res, normalize) => {\n  ...\n})\n\nOur mocked response will now look something like this:\nconst res = {\n  data: {\n    Person: {\n      id: \"05438a43-00e5-4e2d-9720-ecb1bc9093b9\",\n      firstName: \"0bf14db1\",\n      age: 50123,\n      Friend: {\n        id: \"8a008933-b5c3-4809-aef7-5a3c34c1c3b6\",\n        firstName: \"c6187c73\",\n        age: 45674\n      },\n      Pets: [\n        {\n          __type: \"Cat\",\n          id: \"efaaa503-d453-4191-a177-307774d2ab10\",\n          name: \"f0b2b542\"\n        },\n        {\n          __type: \"Dog\",\n          id: \"6a146a9c-779b-486a-bc13-25b72c6d555e,\n          breed: \"6a146a9c\",\n          name: \"b245d540\"\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAll the generated data is in the correct format in this example, but it isn't very human readable - for example, the persons name is 0bf14db1.
