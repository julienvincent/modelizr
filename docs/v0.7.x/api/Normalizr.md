# Normalizer

This is a wrapper around [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr). Please read the normalizr documentation if you are not already familiar with it.

#### `normalize(response, ...models)`

Normalize a response based on given models. Returns the normalized flat-map

Given the following response:
```javascript
const response = {
    users: [
        {
            id: 1,
            ...,
            books: [
                {
                    id: 1,
                    ...
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

```javascript
// ...

import { normalize } from 'modelizr'

normalize(
    response,
    user(
        book()
    )
)
```
Normalizr will produce the following flat-map:
```javascript
{
    entities: {
        users: {
            1: {
                id: 1,
                ...,
                books: [
                    1,
                    ...
                ]
            }
        },
        books: {
            i: {
                id: 1,
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```
